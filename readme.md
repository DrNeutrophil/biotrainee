Note : Please don't use it if you are not the fan of our Biotrainee, Thanks.

### Install it  by the codes below:

```

It will install many other packages for you automately, such as : `ALL, CLL, pasilla, airway ,limma，DESeq2，clusterProfiler  ` , that's why it will take a long time to finish if all of these packages are not installed before in your computer.
